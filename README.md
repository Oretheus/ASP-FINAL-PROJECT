# ASP-Frontend

1. Tried to align my code to that of what you asked. Ive used Quasar q cards - again i have never used Quasar and am still learning this new framwork also.
2. I believe that i have fixed the input fields so that they only display what is required when nothing is entered- please confirm this works for you now.
3. Password strength altered as was impossible to get a stron password before! maybe a little too easy now but its a good proof of concept.

4. i still do not have endpoints so am not currently not capturing the registration details to be used for login.
